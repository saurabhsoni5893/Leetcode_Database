Table: Project

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.

Table: Employee

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

The query result format is in the following example:

Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

-- SQL Schema:

Create table Project (project_id int, employee_id int)
Create table Employee (employee_id int, name varchar(10), experience_years int)

Truncate table Project
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '1')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '2')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '3')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('2', '1')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('2', '4')

Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('1', 'Khaled', '3')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('2', 'Ali', '2')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('3', 'John', '1')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('4', 'Doe', '2')

-- Solution:

SELECT project_id, round(cast(sum(experience_years) as decimal(3,2))/cast(count(p.employee_id) as decimal(3,2)), 2) as average_years
FROM project p inner join employee e
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY project_id
