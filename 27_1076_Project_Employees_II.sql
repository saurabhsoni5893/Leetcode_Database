Table: Project

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.

Table: Employee

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table.
 

Write an SQL query that reports all the projects that have the most employees.

The query result format is in the following example:

Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| project_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
The first project has 3 employees while the second one has 2.

-- SQL Schema:

Create table Project (project_id int, employee_id int)
Create table Employee (employee_id int, name varchar(10), experience_years int)

Truncate table Project
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '1')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '2')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '3')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('2', '1')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('2', '4')

Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('1', 'Khaled', '3')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('2', 'Ali', '2')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('3', 'John', '1')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('4', 'Doe', '2')
